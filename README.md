# 01 Challenge: Code Refactor

In this project I had to refactor the existing code so that it was optimized for search engines
and clean up some code. I changed most of the tags to use semantic tags so that the code could
be more readable, I added alt attributes to every image, in the css I grouped items with the same
code together, to further clean up the code and make it less cluttered. Lastly I made sure all the links worked correctly.
